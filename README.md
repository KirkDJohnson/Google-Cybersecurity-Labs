<h1>Numerous shorter yet important hands on experience</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>Throughout the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification class there were multiple opportunities to get hands on work with interactive labs to put the theory I learned in practice. The images below briefly touch on some of the labs and experience I got from the course/certification.

<h2>Thoughts</h2>
This was the first course/certification I took in cybersecurity. I took it not really sure what cybersecurity really was; only that it sounded interesting and after taking this coursera course I was all in and moved straight into the Cisco course. Similarly to the cisco course because at the time I did not really think about saving my work for a future portfolio and instead was invested in learning as much of I possible, many of the labs I was not able to capture. Particualy the course on Python which I really enjoyed. However, the above labs demonstrate some of the hands on expirence I obtained through completing the Google Cybersecurity Certification.
